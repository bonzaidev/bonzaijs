fruit crush
===========

Ok so this is one of the many upcoming projects that I'll be publishing here.
There are many more to come and with a lot more graphics and game physics.
This build is not yet complete and I would be putting many other game elements here along with a number of levels.

Fruit Crush is basically a game where we need to make as many pairs of similar fruits as we can.
So this game is made with pure javascript with no external js libraries used.
It basically uses a map that guides the flow of the program.
Checking for similar fruits is done by using 4 neighbours.
The game is more about survival than collecting points.
The longer you survive the higher you score.
To survive you need to strategically click on fruits that are forming pairs such that new pairs are formed.

For more info on the project you can email me on niraj_achari@yahoo.co.in

And yeah you can freely use the code to build your own version.
